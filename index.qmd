# 🎲 Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."

## The Coin Flip Investment Game

Imagine you're offered an investment opportunity with these rules:

- **Start with:** $1,000
- **Each year:** A coin is flipped
  - **Heads (50% chance):** Your balance increases by 50%
  - **Tails (50% chance):** Your balance decreases by 40%
- **Duration:** 35 years (from age 20 to 55)
- **Outcome:** You receive the final balance at retirement

**The Question:** Is this a good investment? What would you expect to happen?

# 🧮 Mathematical Analysis

## 1. Expected Value After One Coin Flip

*Let's start by understanding what should happen mathematically...*

```{r}
#| label: expected-value-analysis

# Calculate expected value after 1 coin flip
prob_heads <- 0.5
prob_tails <- 0.5
heads_outcome <- initial_balance * heads_multiplier  # $1,000 * 1.5 = $1,500
tails_outcome <- initial_balance * tails_multiplier  # $1,000 * 0.6 = $600

expected_value_1_flip <- prob_heads * heads_outcome + prob_tails * tails_outcome

# Store for display
invisible({
  ev_analysis <- list(
    initial_balance = initial_balance,
    heads_outcome = heads_outcome,
    tails_outcome = tails_outcome,
    expected_value_1_flip = expected_value_1_flip,
    expected_return_pct = (expected_value_1_flip / initial_balance - 1) * 100
  )
})
```

**Expected Value Calculation:**

- **Initial balance:** $`r format(ev_analysis$initial_balance, big.mark = ",")`
- **Heads outcome (50% chance):** $`r format(ev_analysis$heads_outcome, big.mark = ",")`
- **Tails outcome (50% chance):** $`r format(ev_analysis$tails_outcome, big.mark = ",")`
- **Expected value = 0.5 × $`r format(ev_analysis$heads_outcome, big.mark = ",")` + 0.5 × $`r format(ev_analysis$tails_outcome, big.mark = ",")`**
- **Expected value = $`r format(ev_analysis$expected_value_1_flip, big.mark = ",")`**
- **Expected return = `r round(ev_analysis$expected_return_pct, 1)`%**

## 2. Expectation vs. Reality

*The mathematical expectation tells one story, but reality tells another...*

```{r}
#| label: expectation-vs-reality

# Calculate difference
difference <- expected_value_1_flip - initial_balance
is_positive <- expected_value_1_flip > initial_balance

# Store for display
invisible({
  expectation_analysis <- list(
    expected_value_1_flip = expected_value_1_flip,
    initial_balance = initial_balance,
    difference = difference,
    is_positive = is_positive,
    expected_return_pct = (expected_value_1_flip / initial_balance - 1) * 100
  )
})
```

**Expectation vs. Reality:**

- **Expected value after 1 flip:** $`r format(expectation_analysis$expected_value_1_flip, big.mark = ",")`
- **Initial investment:** $`r format(expectation_analysis$initial_balance, big.mark = ",")`
- **Difference:** $`r format(expectation_analysis$difference, big.mark = ",")`

`r if(expectation_analysis$is_positive) {"✅ **POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE:** The expected value is HIGHER than the initial investment."} else {"❌ **NEGATIVE EXPECTED VALUE:** The expected value is LOWER than the initial investment."}`

This means the game has a `r if(expectation_analysis$is_positive) {"positive"} else {"negative"}` expected return of `r round(expectation_analysis$expected_return_pct, 1)`% per flip.

Based on this, you would expect your account to be worth `r if(expectation_analysis$is_positive) {"MORE"} else {"LESS"}` than $1,000.

**However, this is just the mathematical expectation. The reality is more complex:**
- You have a 50% chance of gaining $500 (ending with $1,500)
- You have a 50% chance of losing $400 (ending with $600)  
- The expected value is positive, but most individual outcomes will be losses!

## 3. Single Simulation Over Time

*Let's follow one person's journey through this investment strategy...*

```{r}
#| label: single-simulation

# Run a single simulation and track balance over time
single_sim <- simulate_game(initial_balance, years_to_retirement, heads_multiplier, tails_multiplier)

# Create data for plotting
years <- 0:years_to_retirement
single_sim_data <- tibble(
  year = years,
  age = 20 + years,  # Starting at age 20
  balance = single_sim$balance_history,
  return_pct = (balance / initial_balance - 1) * 100
)

# Create the plot
p_single <- ggplot(single_sim_data, aes(x = age, y = balance)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue", size = 1) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = initial_balance, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(), trans = "log10") +
  labs(
    title = "Single Simulation: Account Balance Over Time",
    subtitle = paste("Final balance: $", format(round(single_sim$final_balance, 2), big.mark = ","), 
                     " (", round((single_sim$final_balance / initial_balance - 1) * 100, 1), "% return)"),
    x = "Age",
    y = "Account Balance ($, Log Scale)",
    caption = "Red dashed line = Initial $1,000 investment"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = "darkblue"),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, color = "gray"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
  )

print(p_single)

# Analysis of this single simulation
estimated_heads <- (log(single_sim$final_balance / initial_balance) - years_to_retirement * log(0.6)) / (log(1.5) - log(0.6))
estimated_tails <- years_to_retirement - estimated_heads
total_return_pct <- (single_sim$final_balance / initial_balance - 1) * 100
annualized_return <- (single_sim$final_balance / initial_balance)^(1/years_to_retirement) - 1
is_profitable <- single_sim$final_balance > initial_balance

# Store for display
invisible({
  single_sim_analysis <- list(
    starting_age = 20,
    retirement_age = 55,
    initial_balance = initial_balance,
    final_balance = single_sim$final_balance,
    total_return_pct = total_return_pct,
    annualized_return = annualized_return,
    estimated_heads = estimated_heads,
    estimated_tails = estimated_tails,
    is_profitable = is_profitable
  )
})
```

**Single Simulation Analysis:**

- **Starting age:** `r single_sim_analysis$starting_age`
- **Retirement age:** `r single_sim_analysis$retirement_age`
- **Initial balance:** $`r format(single_sim_analysis$initial_balance, big.mark = ",")`
- **Final balance:** $`r format(round(single_sim_analysis$final_balance, 2), big.mark = ",")`
- **Total return:** `r round(single_sim_analysis$total_return_pct, 1)`%
- **Annualized return:** `r round(single_sim_analysis$annualized_return * 100, 3)`%
- **Estimated heads:** `r round(single_sim_analysis$estimated_heads, 1)` out of `r years_to_retirement` flips
- **Estimated tails:** `r round(single_sim_analysis$estimated_tails, 1)` out of `r years_to_retirement` flips

**Commentary:**

`r if(single_sim_analysis$is_profitable) {"🎉 **SUCCESS!** This simulation resulted in a **PROFIT**."} else {"😞 **LOSS!** This simulation resulted in a **LOSS**."}`

The account `r if(single_sim_analysis$is_profitable) {"grew"} else {"shrank"}` from $1,000 to $`r format(round(single_sim_analysis$final_balance, 2), big.mark = ",")`.

This represents a `r round(single_sim_analysis$total_return_pct, 1)`% `r if(single_sim_analysis$is_profitable) {"gain"} else {"loss"}` over 35 years.

This single simulation shows the high volatility of the game. While the expected value is positive, individual outcomes can vary dramatically. The log scale on the y-axis helps visualize the extreme range of possible outcomes.

# 🎯 Key Insights & Conclusions

## The Counter-Intuitive Truth

This simulation reveals a fascinating paradox in investment strategy:

### ✅ **Mathematically Favorable**
- **Expected return:** +5% per year
- **35-year expectation:** ~$5,516 (451% gain)
- **The math says:** This is a profitable strategy

### ❌ **Reality for Most People**
- **Median outcome:** Likely a loss
- **Most participants:** Will lose money
- **Volatility:** Extreme swings make it unsuitable for most investors

## The Investment Lesson

This coin-flip game demonstrates a fundamental principle of finance: **high expected returns don't guarantee good outcomes for most participants**. The combination of volatility and compounding creates a scenario where:

- The mathematical expectation is profitable
- Most people will lose money  
- A few people will become extremely wealthy
- The median outcome is likely negative

## Real-World Parallels

This simulation mirrors many real investment strategies:
- **Cryptocurrency investing:** High volatility with potential for massive gains or losses
- **Penny stocks:** Similar asymmetric risk-return profiles  
- **Leveraged ETFs:** Designed to amplify daily returns but can suffer from volatility drag
- **Startup investing:** Most startups fail, but a few create enormous returns

## Final Recommendation

While the expected value is positive, this strategy is essentially a **high-stakes lottery** where:
- A few winners take home life-changing amounts
- Most participants lose their initial investment
- The risk-reward profile is unsuitable for most investors

**Bottom line:** Understanding the difference between expected value and typical outcomes is crucial in real-world investing. Diversification and risk management matter more than mathematical expectations alone.
